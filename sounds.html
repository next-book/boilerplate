          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="211" id="idea211" data-nb-words="39" data-nb-chars="241">A&nbsp;young forest growing up&nbsp;under your meadows, and wild sumachs and blackberry vines breaking through into your cellar; sturdy pitch pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for want of&nbsp;room, their roots reaching quite under the house.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="213" id="idea213" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="117">Instead of&nbsp;no&nbsp;path to&nbsp;the front-yard gate in&nbsp;the Great Snow—no gate—no front-yard—and no&nbsp;path to&nbsp;the civilized world.</span>
